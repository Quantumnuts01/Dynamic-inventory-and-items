# Dynamic-inventory-and-items

##The goal

The idea of what the inventory should be, was inspired by minecrafty and rpg games like Star wars the old republic. Where the items are stored in stack in a grid.
When making the inventory my goal was to make an inventory capable of handeling multiple stacks of different items as well as being as dynamic as possible in terms of costumization of the grid and items.
