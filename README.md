# Dynamic-inventory-and-items
## Engine
This project was made in Tengine which is the in house engine at Tension and Playgroundsquad.

## What makes this inventory worth using?
Since i wanted to make an inventory capable of holding stacks of as many items as you wanted, the idea was to make a library of item-data, this itemdata would then be used when dropping or picking up items to tell the game what model and icon to use. As well as tracking the ammount of items dropped at once.

The items themselves are able to be modified with components to allow for easilly making new items.
